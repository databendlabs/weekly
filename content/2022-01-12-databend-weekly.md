## Tips

Let's learn a weekly tip from Databend.

### New datatype system design

We need to redesign the `datatype` system because current implementation had some shortcomes.

Now, `DataType` is an enum type:

- We must use specific type after matching.
- We can't use it as generic argument.
- It may involve some nested datatypes.
- And hard to put attributes into it.

Want to find out how we will improve the DataType system? Please check the [RFC - New datatype system design](https://databend.rs/dev/rfcs/query/new-datatype-system).

Plan to jump to specific implementation and track progress? [Databend#3794](https://github.com/datafuselabs/databend/pull/3794) might be for you.
